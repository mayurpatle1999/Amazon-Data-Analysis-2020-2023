📊 Amazon Global Sales and Profitability Analysis (2020-2023)

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive business intelligence and financial analysis of Amazon Global's performance across four fiscal years (2020–2023). The analysis utilizes a PowerBI dashboard, built on underlying Excel data, to dissect sales, profit, and operational efficiency across key dimensions including markets, customer segments, product categories, and logistics channels.

The primary goal is to identify profitability drivers and operational bottlenecks, providing strategic recommendations to maximize future growth and margin.

🔍 Core Insights and Findings

The detailed analysis highlighted critical regional and operational asymmetries:

Geographic & Profitability

Volume Driver: Asia Pacific is the largest market by sales volume, contributing 31.98% of total revenue.

Profit Driver: The United States remains the highest engine of profitability, generating the largest absolute profit ($21.90bn), showcasing operational maturity and higher margins.

Key Vulnerability: There is a significant profitability gap between high-volume markets (APAC) and the highly profitable USCA market, suggesting higher fulfillment costs or lower ASPs in Asia Pacific.

Operational & Product

Logistics Bottleneck: The business is overwhelmingly dependent on Standard Class shipping ($513.17bn in sales), posing a single point of failure risk and limiting revenue from premium shipping tiers.

Profit Concentration: Profitability is concentrated in high-value B2B/tech products. Copiers ($19.07bn) and Phones ($16.53bn) are the top two profit drivers.

Segment Focus: The Consumer Segment drives the majority of sales, but the Corporate/Home Office segments represent a high-potential, high-margin growth opportunity, especially for products like Copiers and Chairs.

💡 Strategic Recommendations

The full report provides detailed action plans, summarized here:

Profitability Mandate in APAC: Launch a task force to optimize COGS, fulfillment costs, and return rates in Asia Pacific to close the margin gap with the US.

Shift Shipping Mix: Implement customer incentivization programs to reduce the cost differential between Standard and premium shipping tiers (Second/First Class).

Targeted B2B Expansion: Create specialized pricing and logistics solutions for Corporate clients to capture high-margin revenue from top categories like Copiers and Chairs.

Portfolio Optimization: Leverage top profit categories (Copiers, Phones) for targeted cross-selling of Accessories, and consider shifting bulky, lower-density items (Bookcases, Storage) to a Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) model to free up warehouse space.
